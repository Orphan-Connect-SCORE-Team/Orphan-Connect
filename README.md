# Orphan-Connect
Orphan Connect is an Android application that allows for the secure donation of funds to directly benefit orphans affected by the ongoing civil war in Southern Cameroons. The Department of Health and Social Services in the Federal Republic of Ambazonia is cataloguing the orphans and providing basic information about them, which Orphan Connect displays in order to allow users to choose a child or even multiple children to donate to. Orphan Connect also hopes to raise awareness about the plight of the children in the Ambazonia, and serve as a conduit for help from well wishers across the world who are interested in sponsoring these children in school, providing food and clothing, and meeting other essential needs.
